- 👋 Hi, I’m @Amireallymeorhaveibeenbooleened
- 👀 I’m interested in ...finding out how someone or something keeps  jumping  from phone to computer to new phone and  changes permissions from the first time anything is booted up  since aug 21st 2020 have ave had multiple note 20 ultras taken over, new Linux computer, multiple other iOS and was windows. I cannot shake this. Seems to start with activation of new phones that have to use Google no matter if everything has been changed the phone acts like it has a mind of its own and also just setting up a computer with no internet the computer ends ups at master password or admin password screen after just starting and then rebooting the device. Weird things I have stumbled upon like every phone gets unlocked sim when it should be locked. Passwords changed seconds after entering them. I think it maybe remote hacking and a lot of Google takeouts. I was able to catch a takeout and put it on a drive but didn't get everything. Seems to be tracking me. Put it this way. A brand new phone flashed some update to a aftermarket tv only seconds after being near the truck. Hoping someone could help or point in a direction. I have also recorded with a old camcorder, logs being changed and banking sites, developer for Google and even GitHub being used in my account without me actually logging in. Things like silent keylogger and phone/permission/OS/then list of tons of third party applications. I'm not even sure anyone will see this as I have read  that any feedback is null. New phone even after recovery is starting is at api 3. Reading on recovery boot things like E:[Libfs_Mgr]* notot sure what everything means but I've seen the same phone of a friend's and it doesn't do that on recovery. Also phone seems to use wifi or Bluetooth or something else to change passwords and write over system critical software to I'm assuming be able to jump on and out. I know I'm new but does this sound like anything that may have a name? Or can  it even be stopped at this point. I've used a generator to start up brand new computer in the middle of the woods with 2fa fido5 just to try and get something I can trust some what to try and see what I captured on these flash sticks during a unauthorized Google takeout and other odd things but it's impossible if I can't use anything secure to even check what is going on. Very much need a mentor or at least some direction if possible? Thanks in advance!!
